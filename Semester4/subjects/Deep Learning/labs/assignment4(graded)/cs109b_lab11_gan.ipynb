    "#### TL;DR - There is inherently no \"motivation\" for generator to produce a diverse set of samples as discriminator only penalizes for producing \"bad\" samples. It is easy to learn a few modes than all modes of a multi modal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of the generator G is to fool the discriminator by causing it to assign the generated sample the highest probability of being real as possible. Mathematically, G tries to minimize E_z∼p_z(z)[log(1−D(G(z)))], or in other words, to generate the point x*=G(z) such that x*=argmax_x D(x) (of course, we’re assuming that we hold the discriminator fixed for now; we’re merely describing the optimization objective at a given timestep). Note that this x* is fixed regardless of the value of z, the input to the generator! x* only depends on the discriminator at the given timestep. This means that on expectation, there exists a single fixed point that the generator thinks is the most optimal point to generate regardless of whatever input noise we feed it - there is nothing in the objective function that explicitly forces the generator to generate different samples given the input. During this training step, stochastic gradient descent - again, on expectation - would cause the generator to update its weights towards generating this ideal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This by itself doesn’t immediately mean mode collapse; during the entirety of the training process, mode collapse may happen only partially or not at all. Since training is a stochastic process, during the beginning stages in training the generated samples will vary depending on z and the samples drawn from the real distribution will also vary - this means that gradients backpropagated to the generator will vary between training steps depending on the generated and real samples. Moreover the discriminator, ideally, should be able to identify generator mode collapse while it’s happening and assign the collapse point a low probability to force the generator to spread out. This is why we do see training runs succeed in GAN/DCGAN-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice, especially in default GAN models, mode collapse happens quite often. The discriminator ends up not really forcing more diversity in the generator, so much as simply pushing the partially collapsed generator to a different part of output space - if it assigns the collapse point a low probability, the generator will simply move its collapsed distribution to focus on a new output point. And finally, in the case where the generator has actually collapsed to a single point, it can’t get out; you’ll have to restart your training. To see why this is the case, remember how I said above that the gradient updates to the generator are stochastic, because its generated outputs will vary based on z. Well, in the world where the generator is already collapsed, it will emit the same output for every z. This means that if you feed a batch of generator outputs to the discriminator and get the gradients back, the generator gradients will all essentially be identical. And they’ll all be racing towards the same maximum point x*! Which means the generator will continue to generate the same output regardless of input. Even if the discriminator identifies this and sets the point to low probability, still, the identical gradient updates will cause all outputs of the generator rushing to another fixed point. At this point your training is ruined.\n",
